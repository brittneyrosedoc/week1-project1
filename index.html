        <h2>Reasons to Vote Cthulhu 2016</h2>
        <p> The reasons are obviously multitude why the lord of all evil, Cthulhu, should be president.
            He poses a great question himself - Why choose the lesser evil? If politicians are going to act
            like villians, maybe we should go ahead and elect one that really knows what he's doing.
            This fictional character initially created by H.P. Lovecraft knows how drive his constituants
            and enemies insane just by looking at them. His tentacles, claws, and small wings are sure to
            properly terrify everyone as a proper politician should.</p>
